## How it works
SolarkCloud Companion will fetch solar system data online, initially posted to the cloud via your Solark dongle to Sol-ark servers. It does not have any physical interfaces that are connected directly to your inverter. 
Please also note that this add-on only populates sensor values with data. It does not come with any cards to display information.

This add-on was developed for Solark Region 2 and transitioned from PVPro. Supports multiple inverters series of Sol-Ark.
