## How it works
SolarkCloud will fetch solar system data via the internet, initially posted to the cloud via your Solark dongle. It does not have any physical interfaces that are connected directly to your inverter. 
Please also note that this add-on only populates sensor values with data. It does not come with any cards to display information.

This add-on was developed for Solark Region 2 customers only. Supports multiple inverters.
